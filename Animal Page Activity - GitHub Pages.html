        Elephants are the largest land animals on earth. Their trunks are used to pick up objects, trumpet warnings, greet other elephants, suck up water for drinking or bathing, and much more.
        Both male and female African elephants grow tusks and can either be left- or right-tusked. The tusk that it used most frequently is often smaller from wear and tear.
        Elephant tusks can be used to protect the elephant's trunk, lift and move objects, gather food, strip bark from trees, and be used for defense. During times of drought, elephants even use 
        their tusks to dig holes to find water underground.

        The African elephant is the largest of all elephant species and weighs up to eight tons. Two genetically different African subspecies exist: the savanna and the forest elephant, with a number of characteristics that differentiate them both.
        All elephants are herd animals with a very definite social structure. Herds are led by a matriarch, usually the oldest female, and are made up of daughters, sisters and their offspring. 
        Male elephants stay with the herd through adolescence and then move away as they grow older. They are often independent or sometimes band together in bachelor pods.
